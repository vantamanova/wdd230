                “And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.”

                “Bear one anothers burdens, that they may be light; … mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort
                those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things,
                and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered
                with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life.”
